# Project2_Roblero_Wigglesworth
An AI powered messier object guide. This project focused on taking a Messier CSV on all the Messier catalog and manipulating the data into pandas
dataframes. These dataframes are used to find out all sorts of information on the Messier system such as their constellations, best viewing time, and more. This information is given and asked for in natural language by using an LLM called Claude which will answer any questions on the Messier system. Claude will use the built in functions first to find any information and if that's not enough it will find the answer on its own. 

Make sure you have Conda installed for Numpy, Pandas, Matplot; and make sure to install anthropic, env, and JSON.
